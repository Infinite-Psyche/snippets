# Snippets

We aspire to put as much of our code as realistically possible in packages. However, in some cases code can be either to specific to a project, or simply isn't package-worthy for other reasons. The goal of this repository is to have a centralized location for smaller code snippets and recipes that fall in to that category.

## Contributing

The goal of this repository is to manage our snippets for internal use, so unless you'd come across a typo or another minor error, we won't be accepting pull requests.
